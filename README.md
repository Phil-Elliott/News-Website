# News App


A news application that is connected to the Guardian API. It provides the user with a variety of news tags to choose from. There is also a search bar to use to find specific news articles.


## How it works

The user will first see the homepage, where there are different sections of news articles to choose from. The user can select a section title that will lead to a page of articles related to that topic. The user can also select an article to read that will lead to a separate page with the articles content. The links in the header and the footer can also be used to look through articles. Each link will show a different selection of articles to choose from.

Alternatively the user can use the search bar to search for specific articles. The user can search by typing and clicking the search icon or pressing enter. This will lead to a page that displays 10 articles for the user to choose from. The user also has the ability to load another page of content by using the page navigation on the bottom of the page.

## Software Used

The app was built with React, React Hooks, and TypeScript. All fetch requests are done with Axios. The styling was done with SCSS. 

## What I learned

This project provided me with a great introduction to using TypeScript. I gained a good grasp on the basics and I am looking forward to getting an even better understanding in my next project. I also got to improve my ability to work with data from an API. It required me to use state to pass the information throughout the application. My CSS skills also improved with this project. I made everything responsive and focused on using dryer code with the help of mixins
